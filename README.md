### Group Role Guidelines
**Managers**: Repeat the instructions for the activity when you enter the breakout rooms. Keep the group on task and away from side discussions. Ensure that the group is aware of how much time is left for the activity (maybe keep a timer).

**Recorders**: In your group's ongoing record, maintain a log for this activity. Record details of your group's discussions and findings in your team's shared document.

**Presenters**: Be prepared to present a summary of your group's findings after the class regroups.

**Reflectors**: Maintain the breakpoint documents and share your screen to help keep the group in sync. In the group log, record what the group has done well during this activity, as well as how the group can improve in future activities.
